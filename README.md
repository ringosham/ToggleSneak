# ToggleSneak mod

The OG ToggleSneak back in 1.7.10. Supports toggling sneaking, sprinting, and fly boosting.

The controls are tinkered to be the exact same as the original. Meaning the mod can determine between toggling and holding the sneak/sprint button without any extra hassle.

Originally coded by u/ScrobDobbins. Updated (and now mostly rewritten) by Ringosham for Minecraft 1.12.2
